# Tech lead myths

## Smartest person on the team

The tech lead does not need to be the smartest person on the team; the primary qualification is leadership skills.

## Writes the best code

The best tech lead considers the team as a whole, and knows what everyone's strengths and weaknesses are. They will often defer certain tasks to others' whose specific coding skills are greater than the lead's own skills.

## Makes all technology decisions

While certain teams might be organized this way, the tech lead should not necessary be given the final say or veto power over all technical decisions. This is more of an architect role, which is not necessarily the same as tech lead.  But in any case, it's not necessarily the lead's job.

## Makes the most money

The tech lead might not earn as much compensation as others; it's not an intrinsic perk of the position.

## Motivate people by keeping them to highest standards

This can become a very toxic behavior if the tech lead is always hounding people on standards. It's more important to make sure team members get the help they need and that the team culture as a whole encourages high quality development and high morale.

# What does a tech lead do?

## Increase team effectiveness

The main thing a tech lead should be doing is "helping people get better", both individually but also as a whole team. They need to be thinking of the team's skills and effectiveness and focusing on the team's collective quality and output.

## Defend the team when they make mistakes

This encourages a [[no-blame culture]]. Don't be too quick to blame team members; instead be one of the first people to defend team members to management. 

That doesn't mean we hide the fact that someone made a mistake, but it's important to think of the larger context, and consider that maybe the fact that someone made a mistake was due to faults or deficiencies in the team process or practices. 

## Congratulate people publicly

No longer just show off your own accomplishments but focus on the good work that everyone is doing.  Allowing everyone to feel appreciated will increase morale as a whole and motivate people to do more good work.

## Get team consensus

Instead of making unilateral tech decisions, get buy-in from the whole team at every stage of a tech decision.  Make research communal and decision making open to the whole team. Work to achieve consensus (i.e. don't let debate go on forever, but encourage a real decision to come out of the process.)  Model collaborative decision making for the team.

## Help team through tough situations

Don't withdraw when things get hard. A leader needs to be right in the middle of the worst of it.  

Treat the team how you wish a tech lead would have treated you when things got hard.

# How bad tech leads get promoted

1. Strong individual contributor wants a reward.
2. Management promotes someone for fear they might leave otherwise.
3. Management doesn't understand the tech lead role (they are under one of the misconceptions above.)
# Becoming a tech lead

## Practice defending your team

When a team member makes a mistake or falls behind, try defending them or highlighting positive things that they do.

It shows management and fellow team members that you care about the team as a whole, not just yourself and your own advancement.

## Practice congratulating team

Post on the chat to thank or congratulate people for the good things they do. Not just solving immediate problems or putting out fires, but slow, quiet contributions as well.

## Read books on leadership

- Difficult conversations
- Personal relationships
- Politics
- etc.

But don't read _too_ many books! Read a few good ones and put them into practice.  Learning can be a way to procrastinate.

## Work closely with others

Don't just meet once then go away separately and communicate sparsely. Try to work side by side with people on tasks and projects as much as possible.

## Learn more about the business

The more senior the position, the more you'll be pulled into meetings where you'll be expected to be knowledgeable about the product and the industry you're working with.
