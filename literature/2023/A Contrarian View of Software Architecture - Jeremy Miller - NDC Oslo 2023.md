A tendency in large software systems is for related pieces of code to become scattered throughout the solution, which creates some serious maintenance issues, namely:
1. The code becomes very hard to reason about. The developer is forced to navigate very deep call stacks and maintain a more elaborate mental model in order to answer questions about what the code is doing.
2. Changing the scattered logic becomes a very "high friction" operation. Since the code is not all in one place, seemingly simple changes can take longer, be more complicated, and have a higher impact on system stability than would be desirable (or reasonable).
