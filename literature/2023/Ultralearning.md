# Chapter 3: How to Become an Ultralearner

46
Even if you fail in your own stated ultralearning goal, you will still likely come out of it having learned a new skill well.

47
There are no specific repeatable steps to an ultralearning project; it will look very different for different types of projects. Rather, the best way to understand ultralearning is to understand the basic principles common to every ultralearning project.  These are:
1. **Metalearning**: learning _how_ to learn your subject
2. **Focus**: concentrate well - this is the practical matter of time management, concentration, battling procrastination, etc.
3. **Directness**: Choose learning tasks that attack the skill you want to learn directly. Don't allow yourself to get sidetracked on tasks that seem easier or more fun.
4. **Drill**: Tactically, how to go about learning and mastering skills. It's all about breaking things down well and mastering one piece at a time. _This ability to break down skills and master them one small piece at a time is also called "deliberate practice"._
5. **Retrieval**: Active recall is more effective for learning than passive reading.
6. **Feedback**: Constant, regular feedback is the way to tell how much you're actually learning; it provides the opportunity to adjust your learning methods if it doesn't seem to be working well.
7. **Retention**: Practice the skill of remembering.
8. **Intuition**: Learn to understand subjects deeply by playing and exploring (and attempting to teach others!)  This is more effective than mere rote memorization.
9. **Experimentation**: Explore on your own; don't just follow the path laid down by others.
# Chapter 4: Principle 1: Metalearning
55
It's important to build an internal map of how a subject must be learned. Metalearning is the process by which that map is created. In other words, metalearning is "learning how to learn".  Having a good learning map of a subject is the key to successful learning.

57
A useful way to break down the metalearning process is to identify the "Why?", "What?" and "How?" aspects:
- **"Why?"** involves figuring out your motivation in learning something, which might at first seem tangential, but in fact helps shape your learning map, since you're not trying to learning an entire subject, but only the parts of that subject that help fulfill your personal learning goals.
- **"What?"** refers to the contents of your learning map. It describes the concepts, facts, and procedures you'll need to learn as part of your map.
- **"How?"** refers to the tools, books, and other resources you will use during learning.

60
Interviewing an expert in the subject you want to learn is an effective way to determine if your proposed ultralearning project will actually achieve the goals you want for it. The expert can help validate your project, and help you with your learning map.

61
Even if the reasoning behind your learning project is intrinsic (i.e. the reasons why you want to do it are obvious), it's still important to ask "Why?" you want to learn it. The answers can help you shape your own learning map, which might end up looking substantially different from a standard learning map of this subject.

61-2
When answering the "What?" aspect of metalearning (i.e. "What is the content of my learning map?") you can break it down into three groups: **concepts**, **facts**, and **procedures**.

**Concepts** is everything you need to understand. For example, math theorems and terms, legal principles, etc.

**Facts** is anything you might need to memorize. For example, vocabulary words in a language.

**Procedures** is anything you need to practice, for example, properly pronouncing words in a language.

66
The 10% Rule is a quick guideline to determine how much time to spend metalearning - aka learning how to learn, when doing an ultralearning project. When in doubt, spend approximately 10% of your time researching (or metalearning) and the rest of the time actually learning.

69
While metalearning can have short-term benefits for the current ultralearning project, its true benefit is long-term (and applicable to any other ultralearning project) - it is the ability to learn hard things.

# Chapter 5: Principle 2: Focus: Sharpen Your Knife
74
Learn to recognize when you are procrastinating; that is the first step to avoiding procrastination.

75
The impulse to procrastinate is actually quite a short-lived impulse. If you can stick to the task for even a few minutes, you should be able to outlast that impulse.

78
Flow, or being "in the zone", is not the same thing as "deliberate practice" - the latter requires constantly checking progress against goals and obtaining feedback; it doesn't seem to be compatible with a flow state.

80
Prepare your environment well for an ultralearning project. Try to remove distractions, and make sure everything you need is at hand (so you're not distracted getting up to look for it.)

81
When reading something difficult, there is a danger of entering into "reading hypnosis" where one is only "pantomiming the act of reading", that is following the words one at a time and turning pages, but having ceased to truly analyze and understand what one is reading. 

One possible remedy to reading hypnosis is a more active reading approach of taking short notes and regularly checking one's understanding.
# Chapter 6: Principle 3: Directness: Go Straight Ahead
92
A direct learning approach is often difficult and uncomfortable. For example, speaking a language that you are learning.  It can be very tempting to fall into poorer learning strategies by doing something that seems easier and more fun, like simply watching videos about the language you are learning.

94
**Transfer** is a word used in education to describe when you learn something in one context, and are able to apply it in a completely different context.

It is an ability that formal education has notoriously failed to instill in many students.  This institutional failure to help students apply what they have learned in other contexts is therefore called the **Problem of Transfer**.

97-99
Directness in learning can help solve the problem of transfer. 

If you learn with a "direct connection" to the context in which you want to apply the skill, you don't need as much transfer to occur. 

Furthermore, if you can achieve transfer once in a given skill, it becomes even easier to achieve transfer with that same skill in completely _new_ contexts.

One reason that formal learning doesn't prepare students well for transfer is that this kind of learning is indirect (context-free) rather than direct.

Another way to express this is that you should "learn knowledge as it interacts with reality." That is, always keep your desired context in mind _as_ you learn. Do not learn context-free.  "Build knowledge outward from the kernel of a real situation."

101
Some basic tactics for direct learning are:
1. **Project** - Produce or create something related to what you're learning. If you're learning a coding language, for example, do a project to build something using that language.
2. **Immersive** - Surround yourself with the environment where you must always be practicing the skill. If you're learning to speak a language, put yourself among people speaking that language.
3. **Simulator** - If you can't practice a skill directly (e.g. performing surgery) do the best you can to simulate it accurately.
4. **Overkill** - Increase the challenge so the "skill level is wholly contained within the goal that is set."

# Chapter 7: Principle 4: Drill: Attack Your Weakest Point
- 110 identify rate determining step in learning and drill on it
- 112 seeming tension between direct and drill, but you have to alternate between them
- 113 difficulties in drills: what to drill (experiment), design drills to produce improvement, drills after hard because your focus on what's weak
# Chapter 8: Principle 5: Retrieval: Test to Learn
- 123 principle of feedback, possible explanation, but also active vs passive learning
- 124 why students prefer less effective passive review to active recall: avoidance of feeling of struggling, feeling like they're not ready yet, don't know it well enough to test themselves
- 125 desirable difficulty - wait the correct distance from learning before free recall. Should feel hard but not too
- 128-9 importance of acquiring a breadth of knowledge, since direct practice alone is not enough to make someone an expert
# Chapter 9: Principle 6: Feedback: Don't Dodge the Punches
- 149 good feedback hard to predict; adjust so can't tell if will fail or succeed
- 150 high intensity, rapid feedback. Motivational angle may be more important than actual feedback received
# Chapter 10: Principle 7: Retention: Don't Fill a Leaky Bucket
- 168 most skill go from declarative to procedural, and procedural stays in memory far longer
- 170 one strategy: try to proceduralize certain amount of knowledge in a study session, also try to choose something central and important, that further knowledge branches from
# Chapter 11: Principle 8: Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building Up
- 182-3 experts solve problems using deep mental models, arsenal or stored patterns or chunks, can think in deeper principles
- 185 struggle makes a difference in learning
- 187 "sketch the bike", go deeper, take things apart
- 189 lesson by example helped Feynman learn, feedback rich process to see if you really know
- 190-1 The less you ask questions about something, more likely you don't know about it, and don't know that you don't know
- 192 Feynman technique checks the depth of your understanding on a subject
- 194 Great way to explain a concept is think of God example or analogy
# Chapter 12: Principle 9: Experimentation: Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone
- 202 relentlessly continue experimenting
- 203-4 learning a skill begins with accumulating knowledge but later is unlearning stale and unhelpful techniques. A master figures out the best way to solve problems. Experimentation is how
- 204-5 experiment with: what to learn from, what to learn next
