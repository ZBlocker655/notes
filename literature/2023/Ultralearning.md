# Chapter 2: Why ultralearning matters

27:
[[best times come from solving difficult challenges]]

27-28:
[[era of average skills is ending]]

29:
[[self-education is an affordable alternative to university]]

32:
3 main cases for ultralearning:
1. Accelerate your career
2. Transition to a new career
3. Cultivate a hidden advantage

33
call to ultralearning - vision, curiosity, challenge

34:
[[overcoming challenges changes how you see yourself]]

# Chapter 3: How to Become an Ultralearner

46
Even if you fail in your own stated ultralearning goal, you will still likely come out of it having learned a new skill well.

75
[[impulse to procrastinate is short-lived]]

78
[[flow is not the same thing as deliberate practice]]

Prepare your environment well for an ultralearning project. Try to remove distractions, and make sure everything you need is at hand (so you're not distracted getting up to look for it.)

# Chapter 6: Principle 3: Directness: Go Straight Ahead
92
A direct learning approach is often difficult and uncomfortable. For example, speaking a language that you are learning.  It can be very tempting to fall into poorer learning strategies by doing something that seems easier and more fun, like simply watching videos about the language you are learning.

94
**Transfer** is a word used in education to describe when you learn something in one context, and are able to apply it in a completely different context.

It is an ability that formal education has notoriously failed to instill in many students.  This institutional failure to help students apply what they have learned in other contexts is therefore called the **Problem of Transfer**.

97-99
Directness in learning can help solve the problem of transfer. 

If you learn with a "direct connection" to the context in which you want to apply the skill, you don't need as much transfer to occur. 

Furthermore, if you can achieve transfer once in a given skill, it becomes even easier to achieve transfer with that same skill in completely _new_ contexts.

One reason that formal learning doesn't prepare students well for transfer is that this kind of learning is indirect (context-free) rather than direct.

Another way to express this is that you should "learn knowledge as it interacts with reality." That is, always keep your desired context in mind _as_ you learn. Do not learn context-free.  "Build knowledge outward from the kernel of a real situation."

101
Some basic tactics for direct learning are:
1. **Project** - Produce or create something related to what you're learning. If you're learning a coding language, for example, do a project to build something using that language.
2. **Immersive** - Surround yourself with the environment where you must always be practicing the skill. If you're learning to speak a language, put yourself among people speaking that language.
3. **Simulator** - If you can't practice a skill directly (e.g. performing surgery) do the best you can to simulate it accurately.
4. **Overkill** - Increase the challenge so the "skill level is wholly contained within the goal that is set."

# Chapter 7: Principle 4: Drill: Attack Your Weakest Point
110
If you have gone through the metalearning process to break down your learning into atomic skills and processes, try to identify the "rate-determining step" in your learning. What that means is the particular skill that slows you down the most or affects your practice the most from a lack of mastery of that skill. 

Identify your rate determining step in learning whatever you're learning, then find a way to isolate it and drill on it specifically.

112
There is an apparent tension between the direct learning method of practicing a skill in an environment as close to the real one as possible, and the drill approach - isolating atomic aspects of what you're learning and drilling on them in isolation. 

But while they take opposite approaches, these two methods are both just tools in the learning toolbox.  People in a self-education project can alternate between the two; this can be called a "direct-then-drill" approach. 

First, try to practice the larger skill directly: figuring our how the skill is used and practice it in the same context or environment.  Then, figure out which atomic aspects of that skill need work, isolate them, and drill on them.

A good way to think of it is: first bring it together, then take it apart. Then bring it together again. 

Earlier in the learning process, cycle between Direct and Drill faster. The more advanced you get, the more you can focus on advanced drills to further refine each aspect of what you're learning.

113
difficulties in drills: what to drill (experiment), design drills to produce improvement, drills after hard because your focus on what's weak

Designing good drills to attack learning problems is a subtle skill. There are some problems in the way of designing effective drills:
1. Figuring out what to drill on (and when to drill). It helps to find the rate-determining step in your that affects your learning the most, and drill on that. A good question to ask is "What skill can I improve that will give me the most overall benefit for the least effort?"  What delivers the biggest bang?
2. Designing the drill correctly. Be careful not to, in designing the drill, take away what makes that skill difficult in the real world. 
3. Doing drills is hard! Avoid the temptation to keep them easy and comfortable. Don't be afraid to have things feel hard while you're learning.

Here are a few broad types of drill to keep in mind when designing drills for your self-education project:
1. **Time slicing** - Isolate one part of a sequence of steps and work on that step alone.
2. **Cognitive components** - Isolate one piece of what you're learning, such as grammar from overall language learning.
3. **Copycat** - The parts of the skill that you are _not_ drilling on at the moment, feel free to copy those from somewhere else.
4. **Magnifying glass** - Spend more time on one part of the skill than you normally would, even though you do all the rest of the steps too.
5. **Prerequisite chaining** - Start somewhere, anywhere! When you realize there is a certain dependency, or prerequisite that you need, start learning _that_ dependency, and so on. Eventually you'll build foundational knowledge and skills.
# Chapter 8: Principle 5: Retrieval: Test to Learn
- 123 principle of feedback, possible explanation, but also active vs passive learning
- 124 why students prefer less effective passive review to active recall: avoidance of feeling of struggling, feeling like they're not ready yet, don't know it well enough to test themselves
- 125 desirable difficulty - wait the correct distance from learning before free recall. Should feel hard but not too
- 128-9 importance of acquiring a breadth of knowledge, since direct practice alone is not enough to make someone an expert
# Chapter 9: Principle 6: Feedback: Don't Dodge the Punches
- 149 good feedback hard to predict; adjust so can't tell if will fail or succeed
- 150 high intensity, rapid feedback. Motivational angle may be more important than actual feedback received
# Chapter 10: Principle 7: Retention: Don't Fill a Leaky Bucket
- 168 most skill go from declarative to procedural, and procedural stays in memory far longer
- 170 one strategy: try to proceduralize certain amount of knowledge in a study session, also try to choose something central and important, that further knowledge branches from
# Chapter 11: Principle 8: Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building Up
- 182-3 experts solve problems using deep mental models, arsenal or stored patterns or chunks, can think in deeper principles
- 185 struggle makes a difference in learning
- 187 "sketch the bike", go deeper, take things apart
- 189 lesson by example helped Feynman learn, feedback rich process to see if you really know
- 190-1 The less you ask questions about something, more likely you don't know about it, and don't know that you don't know
- 192 Feynman technique checks the depth of your understanding on a subject
- 194 Great way to explain a concept is think of God example or analogy
# Chapter 12: Principle 9: Experimentation: Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone
- 202 relentlessly continue experimenting
- 203-4 learning a skill begins with accumulating knowledge but later is unlearning stale and unhelpful techniques. A master figures out the best way to solve problems. Experimentation is how
- 204-5 experiment with: what to learn from, what to learn next
- 208 experimental mindset extension of growth mindset; actual plan to grow
- 208 tactics
