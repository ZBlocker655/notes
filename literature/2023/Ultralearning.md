# Chapter 2: Why ultralearning matters

27:
The best times and happiest moments don't come from mere pleasure; they come from solving difficult challenges and realizing we are capable of more than we previously thought.

27-28:
As technology advances and everything integrates on a global scale, the era of "average" skills is ending.  Either you have highly sophisticated technical skills, or you are relegated to various non-skilled job opportunities. The good news is that you can learn _how_ to learn new skills deeply, and thereby have a chance to compete in this new world.

29:
College tuitions are getting more expensive and more and more people cannot afford college. This makes self-education (and being skilled at self-education) a necessary alternative approach to acquiring skills. 

The skills required for one's field (especially technology) also change constantly. It wouldn't be possible or practical to go back to school every time one had to learn a new skill.

32:
3 main cases for ultralearning:
1. Accelerate your career
2. Transition to a new career
3. Cultivate a hidden advantage

33
call to ultralearning - vision, curiosity, challenge

34:
Taking on and accomplishing difficult learning challenges can change how you see yourself. It helps you understand that you can stretch your own limits and become capable of new things you didn't think were possible before.

# Chapter 2: How to Become an Ultralearner

46
Even if you fail in your own stated ultralearning goal, you will still likely come out of it having learned a new skill well.

47
There are no specific repeatable steps to an ultralearning project; it will look very different for different types of projects. Rather, the best way to understand ultralearning is to understand the basic principles common to every ultralearning project.  These are:
1. **Metalearning**: learning _how_ to learn your subject
2. **Focus**: concentrate well - this is the practical matter of time management, concentration, battling procrastination, etc.
3. **Directness**: Choose learning tasks that attack the skill you want to learn directly. Don't allow yourself to get sidetracked on tasks that seem easier or more fun.
4. **Drill**: Tactically, how to go about learning and mastering skills. It's all about breaking things down well and mastering one piece at a time. _This ability to break down skills and master them one small piece at a time is also called "deliberate practice"._
5. **Retrieval**: Active recall is more effective for learning than passive reading.
6. **Feedback**: Constant, regular feedback is the way to tell how much you're actually learning; it provides the opportunity to adjust your learning methods if it doesn't seem to be working well.
7. **Retention**: Practice the skill of remembering.
8. **Intuition**: Learn to understand subjects deeply by playing and exploring (and attempting to teach others!)  This is more effective than mere rote memorization.
9. **Experimentation**: Explore on your own; don't just follow the path laid down by others.
# Chapter 4: Principle 1: Metalearning
- 56 learn how subject works is heart of success
- 57 why/what/how
- 60 expert interview- a way to gain learning map, validate project
- 61 even if intrinsic, asking why is helpful
- 61-2 concept/fact/procedure knowledge map
- 66 10% rule
- 69 long term metalearning is best benefit, universal. "How to learn hard things"

# Chapter 5: Principle 2: Focus: Sharpen Your Knife
- 74 recognize you are procrastinating (step 1)
- 75 impulse to procrastinate (whether due to aversion or distraction) doesn't last long
- 76 progressive strategies
- 78 Flow not necessarily compatible with ultralearning
- 80 prepare environment for UL
- 81 reading hypnosis - pantomiming reading
# Chapter 6: Principle 3: Directness: Go Straight Ahead
- 92 Tempting to avoid direct learning by doing something easier or more fun
- 97 direct learning solved problem of transfer; most formal learning indirect
- 97-8 learn knowledge as it interacts with reality
- 99 Build knowledge outward from kernel of situation
- 101 tactics for direct learning: project etc
# Chapter 7: Principle 4: Drill: Attack Your Weakest Point
- 110 identify rate determining step in learning and drill on it
- 112 seeming tension between direct and drill, but you have to alternate between them
- 113 difficulties in drills: what to drill (experiment), design drills to produce improvement, drills after hard because your focus on what's weak
# Chapter 8: Principle 5: Retrieval: Test to Learn
- 123 principle of feedback, possible explanation, but also active vs passive learning
- 124 why students prefer less effective passive review to active recall: avoidance of feeling of struggling, feeling like they're not ready yet, don't know it well enough to test themselves
- 125 desirable difficulty - wait the correct distance from learning before free recall. Should feel hard but not too
- 128-9 importance of acquiring a breadth of knowledge, since direct practice alone is not enough to make someone an expert
# Chapter 9: Principle 6: Feedback: Don't Dodge the Punches
- 149 good feedback hard to predict; adjust so can't tell if will fail or succeed
- 150 high intensity, rapid feedback. Motivational angle may be more important than actual feedback received
# Chapter 10: Principle 7: Retention: Don't Fill a Leaky Bucket
- 168 most skill go from declarative to procedural, and procedural stays in memory far longer
- 170 one strategy: try to proceduralize certain amount of knowledge in a study session, also try to choose something central and important, that further knowledge branches from
# Chapter 11: Principle 8: Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building Up
- 182-3 experts solve problems using deep mental models, arsenal or stored patterns or chunks, can think in deeper principles
- 185 struggle makes a difference in learning
- 187 "sketch the bike", go deeper, take things apart
- 189 lesson by example helped Feynman learn, feedback rich process to see if you really know
- 190-1 The less you ask questions about something, more likely you don't know about it, and don't know that you don't know
- 192 Feynman technique checks the depth of your understanding on a subject
- 194 Great way to explain a concept is think of God example or analogy
# Chapter 12: Principle 9: Experimentation: Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone
- 202 relentlessly continue experimenting
- 203-4 learning a skill begins with accumulating knowledge but later is unlearning stale and unhelpful techniques. A master figures out the best way to solve problems. Experimentation is how
- 204-5 experiment with: what to learn from, what to learn next
- 208 experimental mindset extension of growth mindset; actual plan to grow
- 208 tactics
