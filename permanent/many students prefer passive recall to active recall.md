Although research has shown that active recall outperforms passive study, especially when being tested much later on, many students still prefer passive recall. 

This might be because passive review (i.e. reading it over) works better in the very short term than active recall (trying to remember everything one can _without_ the book) which leaves the student with a more confident feeling than active recall would. 

Also, students might choose passive review because they feel unready to test themselves (a clear sign that they definitely don't know the material yet!) whereas with active recall, it becomes very clear much sooner what they do and don't know.

However, it's active recall that has been shown to more successfully imprint on long-term memory.
