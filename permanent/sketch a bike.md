- we think we understand better than we do

It is a common problem that we think we understand a concept better than we actually do. Often our understand goes deep enough for casual understanding, but not deep enough that we are an expert.  We are poor judges, as well, of how deeply we understand. 

Richard Feynman was famously for his efforts to completely take a subject apart and try to put it back together himself, in order to understand it from the inside out, even if he incurred temporary inconvenience in redoing painstaking work that someone else had already done. 

A way to illustrate that the depth of our understanding is an illusion is to sketch an object that we find commonplace but has a degree of complexity, such as a bicycle. Sketch a bike and see how accurately you can reproduce its structure and all of its components and peripherals.
