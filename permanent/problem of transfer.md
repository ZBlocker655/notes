**Transfer** is a word used in education to describe when you learn something in one context, and are able to apply it in a completely different context.

It is an ability that formal education has notoriously failed to instill in many students.  This institutional failure to help students apply what they have learned in other contexts is therefore called the **Problem of Transfer**.
