Experimentation is the learning tool that provides a path toward true mastery. When in the beginning phase of learning a subject, you can use [[metalearning]] techniques to understand the ladder of how to gain knowledge in a subject, and learn basic procedures. 

As time goes by, metalearning becomes less helpful than experimentation, because you get to areas where it's not as clear how to progress forward and there are fewer guidelines. You must experiment to understand better and better.

In addition, the later phases of mastery are less about falling back on rote learning and rote methods, but in a deeper understanding on the best way to solve problems. This often requires a process of "unlearning" the previous rote knowledge and replacing it with the ability to experiment and be able to be creative and solve new and tougher types of problems.
