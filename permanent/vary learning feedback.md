- don't get stuck in feedback that makes you feel good about yourself
---

Successful learners are willing to vary the type of feedback they receive and the tests they give themselves. Otherwise, it's too easy to fall into the trap of always preferring the type of feedback that makes you feel good about yourself. This feeling is to be avoided; it can prevent the most valuable and accurate feedback from reaching you.
