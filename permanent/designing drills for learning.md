Designing good drills to attack learning problems is a subtle skill. There are some problems in the way of designing effective drills:
1. Figuring out what to drill on (and when to drill). It helps to find the rate-determining step in your that affects your learning the most, and [[drill on your rate-determining step|drill on that]]. A good question to ask is "What skill can I improve that will give me the most overall benefit for the least effort?"  What delivers the biggest bang?
2. Designing the drill correctly. Be careful not to, in designing the drill, take away what makes that skill difficult in the real world. 
3. Doing drills is hard! Avoid the temptation to keep them easy and comfortable. Don't be afraid to have things feel hard while you're learning.

## Drill types

Here are a few broad types of drill to keep in mind when designing drills for your self-education project:
1. **Time slicing** - Isolate one part of a sequence of steps and work on that step alone.
2. **Cognitive components** - Isolate one piece of what you're learning, such as grammar from overall language learning.
3. **Copycat** - The parts of the skill that you are _not_ drilling on at the moment, feel free to copy those from somewhere else.
4. **Magnifying glass** - Spend more time on one part of the skill than you normally would, even though you do all the rest of the steps too.
5. **Prerequisite chaining** - Start somewhere, anywhere! When you realize there is a certain dependency, or prerequisite that you need, start learning _that_ dependency, and so on. Eventually you'll build foundational knowledge and skills.
