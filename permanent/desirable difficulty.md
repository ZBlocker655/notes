- active recall should be somewhat difficult
---

The concept of **desirable difficulty** refers to the notion that [[active recall]] _should_ come with some level of effort and challenge. If you do active recall _too_ soon after learning, then the information was already in the short-term memory and the recall effort is fairly mundane and useless. 

Wait a little while, on the other hand, before attempting active recall, and you face the challenge of loading the new knowledge from long-term memory. This difficult or effort is shown to cause things to be remembered better in the long run.

Active recall shouldn't be _too_ difficult, however, but it should be just difficult enough. This is what "desirable difficulty" means.

Consider the image of trimming the sail correctly to maximize the force of the wind acting on the sailboat.  In the same way, there is an optimal level of difficulty.
