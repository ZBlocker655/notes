The Feynman Technique is a simple method pioneered by Richard Feynman that helps you check the depth of your understanding of a subject and, where that understanding is lacking, improve it and check it again in iterative cycles.

**How the method works**

- Study some material.
- Try to explain the idea (either to someone else, or journal as though you were explaining to someone else).
	- If it is a concept, explain it as though the audience had never heard it before.
	- If it is a problem, solve in a way that makes complete sense to you (and explain why it makes sense.)
- If you are unable to fully explain, highlight where you seem stuck, and go back and study again.
