If you have gone through the metalearning process to break down your learning into atomic skills and processes, try to identify the "rate-determining step" in your learning. What that means is the particular skill that slows you down the most or affects your practice the most from a lack of mastery of that skill. 

Identify your rate determining step in learning whatever you're learning, then find a way to isolate it and drill on it specifically.
