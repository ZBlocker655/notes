- Copy or emulate something done by someone else, then attempt a variation.
- Try two different approaches to a problem side-by-side and only change one variable, to isolate it and test what difference it makes.
- Strategically introduce new constraints to force you _not_ to use a previous approach and innovate into something new.
- Combine skills that don't necessarily overlap to produce a new, hybrid compound skill.
- Go outside conventions to some extreme to discover what's possible.
