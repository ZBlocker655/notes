When reading something difficult, there is a danger of entering into "reading hypnosis" where one is only "pantomiming the act of reading", that is following the words one at a time and turning pages, but having ceased to truly analyze and understand what one is reading. 

One possible remedy to reading hypnosis is a more active reading approach of taking short notes and regularly checking one's understanding. This is basically a form of [[deliberate practice]].
