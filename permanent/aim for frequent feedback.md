When designing the kind of [[feedback]] you want to receive during a learning project, aim for feedback that is higher intensity, and more rapid. 

## Advantages

- Getting more frequent feedback helps you self-correct faster and in shorter cycles.
- Getting frequent exposure to feedback helps reduce the fear of feedback that holds us back.
- Knowing that our work will be constantly evaluated motivates us to [[best times come from solving difficult challenges|try harder and do our best work]], and to learn with more intensity.
