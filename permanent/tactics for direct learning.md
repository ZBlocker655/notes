Some basic tactics for direct learning are:
1. **Project** - Produce or create something related to what you're learning. If you're learning a coding language, for example, do a project to build something using that language.
2. **Immersive** - Surround yourself with the environment where you must always be practicing the skill. If you're learning to speak a language, put yourself among people speaking that language.
3. **Simulator** - If you can't practice a skill directly (e.g. performing surgery) do the best you can to simulate it accurately.
4. **Overkill** - Increase the challenge so the "skill level is wholly contained within the goal that is set."
