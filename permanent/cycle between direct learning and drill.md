There is an apparent tension between the direct learning method of practicing a skill in an environment as close to the real one as possible, and the drill approach - isolating atomic aspects of what you're learning and drilling on them in isolation. 

But while they take opposite approaches, these two methods are both just tools in the learning toolbox.  People in a self-education project can alternate between the two; this can be called a "direct-then-drill" approach. 

First, try to practice the larger skill directly: figuring our how the skill is used and practice it in the same context or environment.  Then, figure out which atomic aspects of that skill need work, isolate them, and drill on them.

A good way to think of it is: first bring it together, then take it apart. Then bring it together again. 

Earlier in the learning process, cycle between Direct and Drill faster. The more advanced you get, the more you can focus on advanced drills to further refine each aspect of what you're learning.
