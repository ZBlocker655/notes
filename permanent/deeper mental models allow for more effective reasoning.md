What may appear to be a quality of "magic" or genius in an expert may be explained by the expert having a deep arsenal of mental "chunks", or deeper models about a subject.  Using these mental chunks, an expert can reason more clearly, deeply and effectively about a problem than a beginner can, because the beginning is forced to work from first principles every time, and has no deep [[mental model]] to fall back on.

An expert uses their library of chunks, or patterns, to compose solutions to new problems because they can perceive the principles that would be useful to solve or reason about a problem much more quickly than a beginner can.
