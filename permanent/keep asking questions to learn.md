The more you learn about a subject the more question come up about it. Exploring these questions and coming up with more questions as a result is a path to expertise. Conversely, if you don't tend to ask questions, not only will you not deepen your understanding of a subject, but the more you will have an inflated opinion of your own understanding.  In other words, you will not know how little you really know.  This is called the **Dunning-Kruger Effect**.
