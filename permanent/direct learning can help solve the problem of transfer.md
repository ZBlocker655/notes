Directness in learning can help solve the [[problem of transfer]]. 

If you learn with a "direct connection" to the context in which you want to apply the skill, you don't need as much transfer to occur. 

Furthermore, if you can achieve transfer once in a given skill, it becomes even easier to achieve transfer with that same skill in completely _new_ contexts.

One reason that formal learning doesn't prepare students well for transfer is that this kind of learning is indirect (context-free) rather than direct.

Another way to express this is that you should "learn knowledge as it interacts with reality." That is, always keep your desired context in mind _as_ you learn. Do not learn context-free.  "Build knowledge outward from the kernel of a real situation."
