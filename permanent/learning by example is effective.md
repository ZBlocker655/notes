Learning by example is a powerful method. It forces a deeper understanding of the subject, because you are forced to apply what you _think_ you know and make it work in a real (even if contrived) situation. 

It is usually worthwhile to come up with a real example, if there is not one present in the lesson.

It is considered a "feedback-rich process" because it helps you see how well you truly understand what you are learning.

For explaining or understanding difficult concepts, instead of diving into the details of the concept in a straightforward way, approach understanding using concrete examples, or create an analogy to link the concept to another one more familiar to the audience.
