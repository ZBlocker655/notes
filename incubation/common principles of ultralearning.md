There are no specific repeatable steps to an ultralearning project; it will look very different for different types of projects. Rather, the best way to understand ultralearning is to understand the basic principles common to every ultralearning project.  These are:
1. **[[Metalearning]]**: learning _how_ to learn your subject
2. **Focus**: concentrate well - this is the practical matter of time management, concentration, battling procrastination, etc.
3. **Directness**: Choose learning tasks that attack the skill you want to learn directly. Don't allow yourself to get sidetracked on tasks that seem easier or more fun.
4. **Drill**: Tactically, how to go about learning and mastering skills. It's all about breaking things down well and mastering one piece at a time. _This ability to break down skills and master them one small piece at a time is also called "deliberate practice"._
5. **Retrieval**: Active recall is more effective for learning than passive reading.
6. **Feedback**: Constant, regular feedback is the way to tell how much you're actually learning; it provides the opportunity to adjust your learning methods if it doesn't seem to be working well.
7. **Retention**: Practice the skill of remembering.
8. **Intuition**: Learn to understand subjects deeply by playing and exploring (and attempting to teach others!)  This is more effective than mere rote memorization.
9. **Experimentation**: Explore on your own; don't just follow the path laid down by others.
