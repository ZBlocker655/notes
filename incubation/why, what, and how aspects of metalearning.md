A useful way to break down the [[metalearning]] process is to identify the "Why?", "What?" and "How?" aspects:
- **"Why?"** involves figuring out your motivation in learning something, which might at first seem tangential, but in fact helps shape your learning map, since you're not trying to learning an entire subject, but only the parts of that subject that help fulfill your personal learning goals.
- **"What?"** refers to the contents of your learning map. It describes the concepts, facts, and procedures you'll need to learn as part of your map.
- **"How?"** refers to the tools, books, and other resources you will use during learning.
