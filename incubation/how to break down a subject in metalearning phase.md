When answering the "What?" aspect of metalearning (i.e. "What is the content of my learning map?") you can break it down into three groups: **concepts**, **facts**, and **procedures**.

**Concepts** is everything you need to understand. For example, math theorems and terms, legal principles, etc.

**Facts** is anything you might need to memorize. For example, vocabulary words in a language.

**Procedures** is anything you need to practice, for example, properly pronouncing words in a language.
