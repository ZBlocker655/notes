College tuitions are getting more expensive and more and more people cannot afford college. This makes self-education (and being skilled at self-education) a necessary alternative approach to acquiring skills. 

The skills required for one's field (especially technology) also change constantly. It wouldn't be possible or practical to go back to school every time one had to learn a new skill.
