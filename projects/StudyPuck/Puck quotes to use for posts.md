[All of Puck's lines](https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/characters/charlines.php?CharID=Puck&WorkID=midsummer&cues=0&longspeeches=1)

> Thou speak'st aright;  
> I am that merry wanderer of the night.

> I'll put a girdle round about the earth  
> In forty minutes.

> Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.

> Through the forest have I gone.  
> But Athenian found I none,  
> On whose eyes I might approve

> What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here

> I go, I go; look how I go,  
> Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.

> Shall we their fond pageant see?  
> Lord, what fools these mortals be!

> And those things do best please me  
> That befal preposterously.

> Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.  
>Did not you tell me I should know the man  
> By the Athenian garment be had on?

> My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,  
> For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,  
> And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;

> Now, when thou wakest, with thine  
> own fool's eyes peep.

> Now it is the time of night  
> That the graves all gaping wide,  
> Every one lets forth his sprite,  
> In the church-way paths to glide:  
> And we fairies, that do run  
> By the triple Hecate's team,  
> From the presence of the sun,  
> Following darkness like a dream,  
> Now are frolic: not a mouse  
> Shall disturb this hallow'd house:  
> I am sent with broom before,  
> To sweep the dust behind the door.

> If we shadows have offended,  
> Think but this, and all is mended,  
> That you have but slumber'd here  
> While these visions did appear.  
> And this weak and idle theme,  
> No more yielding but a dream,  
> Gentles, do not reprehend:  
> if you pardon, we will mend:  
> And, as I am an honest Puck,  
> If we have unearned luck  
> Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,  
> We will make amends ere long;  
> Else the Puck a liar call;  
> So, good night unto you all.  
> Give me your hands, if we be friends,  
> And Robin shall restore amends.
